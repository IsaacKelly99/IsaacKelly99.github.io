# ML supervised learning
## Project 1:
# [Hearth attack prediction](https://github.com/IsaacKelly99/IKR/blob/master/Heart_attack_analysis.ipynb)
  Using the heart attack analysis prediction dataset i will try to predict the probability of someone getting a heart attack based on the given data.
  
  Making use of the next tools:
  * KNN classifier and data pipelines to fit and predict the model.
  * Scaling to scale the data and obtain a higher and precission.
  * train_test_split to split the data.
  * classification report to obtain the performance of the model
  and
  * GridsearchCV to choose the best hyperparameters for the KNN classifier.

## Project 2:
# [Credit card aproval](https://github.com/IsaacKelly99/IKR/blob/master/Credit_card_aproval.ipynb)
  I built a model to predict whether a bank user will get an aproval on a new credit card or get rejected

  Tools used:
  * Label encoder
  * Iterative imputation
  * train,test split
  * Standard scaler
  * Stacking classifier
  * metrics: accuracy_score, matthews_corrcoef, f1_score

# ML unsupervised learning
## Project 3:
# [Wikipedia recommender](https://github.com/IsaacKelly99/IKR/blob/master/wikipedia_recomendations.ipynb)
  I created a wikipedia recommender program using NMF from the sckit learn- decomposition module

  Tools used:
  * TfidfVectorizer, to create a tfidf from the dataframe
  * normalize
  * TruncatedSVD
  * make_pipeline
  * Kmeans, for clustering
  * pandas: read_csv, loc, dot, etc.
  * numpy

## Project 4:
# [Pizza clients clustering](https://github.com/IsaacKelly99/IKR/blob/master/Pizza_clustering_and_recomendations.ipynb)
  This time i created an unsupervised learning model to cluster the likes of 200 pizza clients, based on the ingredients they like, its spicyness, age, gender, etc. Using KMeans   clustering

  Other tools used:
  *  Principal components analysis (PCA)
  *  Standard Scaler
  *  Label encoder
  *  Matplotlib
  *  Pandas
  *  Numpy

# Deep learning
## Project 5
# [Videogame sales, classification and prediction](https://github.com/IsaacKelly99/IKR/blob/master/Videogame_sales.ipynb)
(work in progress)
## Deep learning
I will build a model to predict the sales of a game based on its name, console, genre, year and publisher, and whether or not it will win an award, using a X input and two outputs keras model
