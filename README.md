# IsaacKelly99 projects 

# Project 1: 
## ML supervised learning
# [Hearth attack prediction](https://github.com/IsaacKelly99/IKR/blob/master/Heart_attack_analysis.ipynb)
  Using the heart attack analysis prediction dataset i will try to predict the probability of someone getting a heart attack based on the given data.
  
  Making use of the next tools:
  * KNN classifier and data pipelines to fit and predict the model.
  * Scaling to scale the data and obtain a higher and precission.
  * train_test_split to split the data.
  * classification report to obtain the performance of the model
  and
  * GridsearchCV to choose the best hyperparameters for the KNN classifier.

# Project 2: 
## ML unsupervised learning
# [Wikipedia recommender](https://github.com/IsaacKelly99/IKR/blob/master/wikipedia_recomendations.ipynb)
  I created a wikipedia recommender program using NMF from the sckit learn- decomposition module

  Tools used:
  * TfidfVectorizer, to create a tfidf from the dataframe
  * normalize
  * TruncatedSVD
  * make_pipeline
  * Kmeans, for clustering
  * pandas: read_csv, loc, dot, etc.
  * numpy
