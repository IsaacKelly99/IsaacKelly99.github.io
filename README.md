# Project 1: 
# [Hearth attack prediction](https://github.com/IsaacKelly99/IKR/blob/master/Heart_attack_analysis.ipynb)
  Using the heart attack analysis prediction dataset i will try to predict the probability of someone getting a heart attack based on the given data.
  
  Making use of the next tools:
  * KNN classifier and data pipelines to fit and predict the model.
  * Scaling to scale the data and obtain a higher and precission.
  * train_test_split to split the data.
  * classification report to obtain the performance of the model
  and
  * GridsearchCV to choose the best hyperparameters for the KNN classifier.
