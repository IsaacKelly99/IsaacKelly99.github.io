# Project 1: 
"# Hearth attack prediction\n",
  "Using the heart attack analysis prediction dataset i will try to predict the probability of someone getting a heart attack based on the given data.\n",
  "\n",
  "Making use of the next tools: \n",
  "* KNN classifier and data pipelines to fit and predict the model.\n",
  "* Scaling to scale the data and obtain a higher and precission.\n",
  "* train_test_split to split the data.\n",
  "* classification report to obtain the performance of the model \n",
  "and\n",
  "* GridsearchCV to choose the best hyperparameters for the KNN classifier.\n",
